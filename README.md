[Carpool Casual](http://www.carpoolcasual.com) is the most convenient way to arrange shared rides to and from events with people who share similar interests.

By focusing on arranging carpools between participants of an event with a common arrival time and destination, a trusted community of people with similar interests is created. Equally important, having a common destination makes carpooling convenient for the driver which will increase adoption of carpooling.

Casual Carpool was developed on March 22nd, 2015 for the [Hack the Commute](http://hackthecommute.seattle.gov).

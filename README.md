[Carpool Casual](http://www.carpoolcasual.com) is the most convenient way to arrange shared rides to and from events with people who share similar interests.

By focusing on arranging carpools between participants of an event with a common arrival time and destination, a trusted community of people with similar interests is created. Equally important, having a common destination makes carpooling convenient for the driver which will increase adoption of carpooling.

Casual Carpool was developed on March 22nd, 2015 for the [Hack the Commute](http://hackthecommute.seattle.gov).

Our app is live at http://example.com/awesome-app-that-doesnt-exist. You can log in as the demo user "unicorns" with password "sartfarkles". You can also check out [this demo screencast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) of our application on YouTube.

## Challenge and Approach

Our submission seeks to solve two problems:

1. Encourage users to select options that relieve pressure on the overall transportation network
2. Create an app that serves citizens at all income levels ï¿¼and from all neighborhoods

Our approach for satisfying this challenge was to:

- Create a beta signup version to test carpooling interest to common destination
- Create a responsive HTML app so all that's needed is a browser. You don't have to own a smartphone, and that means we can target users in all demographics.
- Only one event is available for this implementation
- Design algorithm to match passengers to driver based upon available seats and proximity to driver
- Email users when matches are found
